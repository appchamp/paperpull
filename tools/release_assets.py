"""What a release carries besides its packages, for tools/release.sh.

    python tools/release_assets.py kit 0.44.0 <folder>           PaperPull-Server-0.44.0.zip there
    python tools/release_assets.py label <file name> 0.44.0      the label the Assets list shows
    python tools/release_assets.py notes 0.44.0 <notes> <out>    the notes, ending with Downloads
    python tools/release_assets.py assets 0.44.0 <folder>        every file, in order, or what is missing

PaperPull Server has no package of its own. The Server image workflow
publishes its image to GitHub's container registry when the release is
published, and what a person needs besides is compose.yaml and the security
profile beside it. So the release carries those two as a zip, taken from the
release's own tag and nothing else, with a note on where the setup guide is.

Every file in the Assets list carries a label that says what it is for, and
the notes end with a Downloads section that says the same at more length,
unless they already have one. 0.43.0 got all three by hand after it was
published, and these keep every later release the same.

A release carries every one of its files or is not made. The Downloads
section names each of them whether or not it came down, so a release that
went out without one would point people at a file it does not have.
