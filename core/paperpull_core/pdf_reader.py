"""Reading a PDF in a process of its own, with a time and a memory it may
not pass.

pypdf reads a PDF in the process that asks, and a PDF can be made to keep
it busy for as long as it likes or to fill the memory, a page tree that
refers back to itself, a stream that unpacks to gigabytes, a cross
reference table that has to be rebuilt object by object. pypdf 6 bounds
some of these and older ones bound none, and an install keeps whatever
pypdf it was set up with. A thread cannot be stopped from outside in
Python, so the reading happens in a worker process, and the worker is
stopped when it passes intake.PDF_SECONDS or intake.PDF_MEMORY_BYTES.

One worker serves the whole run and is started the first time a PDF is
read, so a document costs a round trip to it rather than a new Python. It
is the same interpreter with the same import path as the app, and it is
handed the folder of the same paperpull_core, so a checkout's core and an
install's are read alike. Its memory is held by the system where the
system can hold it, a job object on Windows and an address space limit on
Linux, and by a watch inside the worker on macOS, which enforces neither.
A worker stopped for either limit is replaced on the next read.

A PDF refused for a limit is remembered for the rest of the run by its
content, so the same bytes are never read twice, a copy in Manual Review
checked again or a second download of the same document. Nothing here
deletes or moves a file. A caller told that a PDF was refused keeps it
wherever it keeps a PDF it refuses.

Where no worker can be started, a frozen build or a system that refuses
the process, the PDF is read here as it always was, and the log says so
once. A limit never refuses a PDF because a reader would not start, and a
reader stopped once from outside is given the PDF again in a new one.
